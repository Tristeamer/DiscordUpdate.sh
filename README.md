# DiscordUpdate.sh


A small script to download and install discord from a tarball because I got tired of waiting like a week for discord to be added to the RPMFusion repo after it gets an update because for whatever reason discord makes no way to ignore their automatic updates and only package discord as a `.deb` or a `.tar.gz` leaving you unable to even open a dedicated discord client until the update gets added to RPMFusion.

To be honest I'm not sure if I will update this with more features or not bc I mostly will just use this until it breaks and then fix it and repeat the cycle :v

I'll probably still try to fix bugs though :)

## Installation/Usage

1. Download `DiscordUpdate.sh` from this repo.
2. run `chmod u+x DiscordUpdate.sh` in the directory that `DiscordUpdate.sh` is downloaded to.
3. run `DiscordUpdate.sh`

yea the code is shit but idc, if it works it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
